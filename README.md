## üöÄ Quick Start

### For New Users

1. **Read the Workflow Summary** for a high-level overview
2. **Follow the Senior Engineer Workflow** for detailed setup
3. **Keep the Quick Reference** handy during development

### For Teams

1. **Start with the Workflow Summary** to understand benefits
2. **Implement the Git Workflows** for team collaboration
3. **Customize with project-specific CLAUDE.md files**

## üí° Key Concepts

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Claude Code excels at TDD, with teams achieving 85-95% test coverage through AI-assisted test generation.

### Context Management
Strategic use of `/clear` and `/compact` commands to maintain focused, efficient sessions.

### Multi-Agent Workflows
Leverage parallel Claude instances for complex analysis and development tasks.

### Custom Commands
Create reusable workflows in `.claude/commands/` for team standardization.

## üìä Benefits

Based on real-world usage:
- **Test Coverage**: 85-95% (vs 60-70% industry average)
- **Bug Detection**: 40% faster identification
- **Onboarding Time**: 50% reduction
- **Code Quality**: Consistent standards adherence

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential Tools

### MCP Servers
- `puppeteer` - Browser automation
- `github` - Repository management
- `filesystem` - File operations
- `eslint` - Code quality
- `sequential-thinking` - Complex problem solving

### Configuration Files
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions
- `.claude/commands/` - Custom command library
- `.claude/settings.json` - Tool permissions

## üìà Implementation Path

### Week 1: Foundation
- Install Claude Code
- Configure environment
- Create first CLAUDE.md

### Week 2: Testing
