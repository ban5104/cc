# Claude Code Senior Engineer Workflow - Executive Summary

## 🎯 Key Findings from Best Practices Analysis

### 1. **Test-Driven Development is Optimal**
Claude Code excels at TDD, with teams reporting 85-95% test coverage. The AI's iterative approach naturally aligns with the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

### 2. **Context Management is Critical**
- Use `/clear` between unrelated tasks
- Apply `/compact` at natural breakpoints  
- Maintain focused CLAUDE.md files
- Strategic use prevents context overflow

### 3. **Parallel Workflows Multiply Productivity**
- Git worktrees enable simultaneous feature development
- Multi-agent analysis provides comprehensive insights
- Concurrent tool calls reduce waiting time

### 4. **Custom Commands Enable Team Standardization**
- Project-specific workflows in `.claude/commands/`
- Shareable patterns across team members
- Automation of repetitive tasks

### 5. **Extended Thinking Solves Complex Problems**
- "ultrathink" for architecture decisions
- "think hard" for debugging intricate issues
- Structured reasoning improves solution quality
