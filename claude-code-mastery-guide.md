## Introduction: Why Claude Code Changes Everything {#introduction}

Claude Code isn't just another AI coding assistant - it's a paradigm shift in how developers interact with AI. As someone who's been deeply involved in its development, I'll share the insider knowledge that will transform you from a casual user to a Claude Code power user.

### Core Philosophy
- **Context is King**: Claude Code maintains full awareness of your entire project
- **Tool Integration**: It's not just about code generation - it's about orchestrating your entire development workflow
- **Memory Persistence**: Your preferences and project knowledge persist across sessions
- **Extensibility**: Through MCP, you can connect Claude to literally any tool or service

## The Power of CLAUDE.md Files {#claude-md-files}

CLAUDE.md files are your secret weapon for creating a personalized AI assistant that truly understands your needs.

### The Three-Tier Memory System

1. **User Memory** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
   - Your personal preferences across all projects
   - Global coding standards and preferences
   - Personal workflow optimizations

2. **Project Memory** (`./CLAUDE.md`)
   - Project-specific architecture and conventions
   - Team standards and workflows
   - API documentation and patterns

3. **Dynamic Imports**
   - Use `@path/to/file` syntax to import other files
   - Maximum depth of 5 hops prevents circular dependencies
   - Perfect for modular documentation

### Professional CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# Project: [Your Project Name]
Last Updated: [Date]

## Quick Reference
- Primary language: [Language]
- Framework: [Framework]
- Build command: npm run build
- Test command: npm test
- Lint command: npm run lint

## Architecture Overview
@docs/architecture.md

## Coding Standards
### Language Specifics
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Use 2-space indentation (NOT tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (UserProfile, NavigationBar)
- Functions: camelCase (getUserData, calculateTotal)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (API_BASE_URL, MAX_RETRIES)
- Files: kebab-case (user-profile.tsx, api-client.ts)

## API Patterns
### Authentication
- All API calls require Bearer token in Authorization header
- Token refresh endpoint: POST /api/auth/refresh
- Store tokens in httpOnly cookies, never localStorage

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  const data = await apiCall();
  return { success: true, data };
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('API call failed:', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
```

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
2. Run tests before committing: npm test
3. Use conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:
4. Create PR with detailed description
5. Ensure all CI checks pass

## Common Tasks
### Adding a New Feature
1. Create component in src/components/[feature]/
2. Add tests in same directory with .test.tsx extension
3. Update routing in src/routes/index.tsx
4. Document in docs/features/[feature].md

### Debugging Production Issues
1. Check logs: npm run logs:prod
2. Review monitoring dashboard: [URL]
3. Test in staging first: npm run deploy:staging

## External Resources
- Design System: @design/tokens.json
- API Documentation: @docs/api/
- Database Schema: @docs/database/schema.sql

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy load routes using React.lazy()
- Implement virtual scrolling for lists > 100 items
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Profile with React DevTools before optimizing

## Security Guidelines
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement CSP headers
- Regular dependency updates

## Team Conventions
- Daily standup: 9:30 AM
- Code reviews required for all PRs
- Deploy to production on Wednesdays
- On-call rotation documented in @docs/oncall.md
```

### Quick Memory Addition
Start any message with `#` to quickly add to memory:
```
# Always use Prettier with single quotes and no semicolons
```

## Mastering Slash Commands {#slash-commands}

### Essential Built-in Commands

#### Productivity Boosters
- `/init` - Initialize a new project with tailored CLAUDE.md
- `/compact` - Compress conversation when context gets large
- `/cost` - Monitor token usage (essential for budget management)
- `/doctor` - Diagnose Claude Code issues before they become problems

#### Advanced Session Management
- `/continue` - Seamlessly resume your last conversation
- `/resume` - Pick from previous sessions with full context
- `/clear` - Start fresh when switching contexts

#### Configuration and Customization
- `/config` - Modify settings on the fly
- `/memory` - Edit CLAUDE.md files in your system editor
- `/model` - Switch between models based on task complexity

## MCP: Your Gateway to Infinite Capabilities {#mcp-integrations}

### Understanding MCP Architecture

MCP (Model Context Protocol) transforms Claude from a code generator into a full development environment orchestrator.

### Setting Up Professional MCP Configurations

#### Database Integration
```bash
# PostgreSQL for development
claude mcp add postgres-dev stdio /usr/local/bin/postgres-mcp \
  --env POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://dev:dev@localhost:5432/myapp_dev" \
  --scope project

# Production database (read-only)
claude mcp add postgres-prod stdio /usr/local/bin/postgres-mcp \
  --env POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://readonly:pass@prod.db.com:5432/myapp" \
  --env READONLY=true \
  --scope project
```

#### File System Access
```bash
# Project files
claude mcp add project-files stdio /usr/local/bin/fs-mcp \
  --allowed-paths "$(pwd)" \
  --scope project

# Documentation server
claude mcp add docs stdio /usr/local/bin/fs-mcp \
  --allowed-paths "$(pwd)/docs" \
  --scope project
```

### Advanced MCP Workflows

#### 1. Full-Stack Development Flow
```
You: "Analyze the user registration flow and identify bottlenecks"

Claude: *Uses database MCP to analyze query performance*
        *Uses file system MCP to review code*
        *Combines insights to provide optimization recommendations*
```

#### 2. Automated Testing Pipeline
```
You: "Create comprehensive tests for the payment module"

Claude: *Reads existing test patterns via file system MCP*
        *Queries database schema via postgres MCP*
        *Generates tests matching your conventions*
        *Runs tests using test runner MCP*
```

#### 3. Security Audit Workflow
```
You: "Perform security audit on the API endpoints"

Claude: *Scans code for vulnerabilities*
        *Checks database for injection risks*
        *Reviews authentication flows*
        *Generates security report with fixes*
```

### Creating Custom MCP Servers

Basic MCP server template for your tools:
```javascript
// my-tool-mcp-server.js
import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk';

const server = new Server({
  name: 'my-tool',
  version: '1.0.0',
  capabilities: {
    tools: true,
    resources: true
  }
});

// Add your tool's functionality
server.addTool({
  name: 'analyze',
  description: 'Analyze codebase metrics',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      path: { type: 'string' }
    }
  },
  handler: async ({ path }) => {
    // Your tool logic here
    return { metrics: analyzeCode(path) };
  }
});

server.start();
```

## Advanced Workflows and Productivity Hacks {#advanced-workflows}

### Extended Thinking Mode Mastery

Extended thinking isn't just about adding "think" to your prompts - it's about knowing when and how to leverage deep reasoning.

#### When to Use Extended Thinking
1. **Architecture Decisions**: "Think deeply about the implications of moving from monolith to microservices"
2. **Complex Debugging**: "Think harder about why this race condition only occurs in production"
3. **Performance Optimization**: "Think through all possible bottlenecks in this data pipeline"
4. **Security Analysis**: "Think extensively about potential attack vectors in this authentication flow"

#### Extended Thinking Patterns
```
Basic: "think about..."
Deep: "think harder about..."
Comprehensive: "think deeply and thoroughly about..."
Multi-angle: "think about this from multiple perspectives..."
```

### Image-Driven Development

#### UI/UX Implementation Flow
1. Paste mockup: "Here's the design [paste], implement with our component library"
2. Screenshot debugging: "This doesn't match [paste screenshot], fix the styling"
3. Error analysis: "Debug this error [paste console screenshot]"
4. Architecture diagrams: "Implement this architecture [paste diagram]"

### Session Management Pro Tips

#### Workflow Continuity
```bash
# Morning standup prep
claude --continue "Summarize what we accomplished yesterday"

# Context switching between features
claude --resume  # Pick the feature-specific conversation

# Automated reports
claude --print --continue "Generate daily progress report" > report.md
```

#### Conversation Branching Strategy
- Main conversation for feature development
- Separate conversation for debugging sessions
- Dedicated conversation for architecture decisions
- Use descriptive first messages for easy identification

### Performance Optimization Workflows

#### 1. Profiling-Driven Development
```
You: "Profile the application and think about optimization opportunities"

Claude: *Runs profiler via MCP*
        *Analyzes hotspots*
        *Suggests specific optimizations*
        *Implements with benchmarks*
```

#### 2. Incremental Refactoring
```
You: "Refactor the user service to improve performance, one method at a time"

Claude: *Analyzes current implementation*
        *Creates refactoring plan*
        *Implements incrementally with tests*
        *Measures improvement at each step*
```

## System Prompts and Configuration {#system-configuration}

### Custom System Prompts

While Claude Code has optimized system prompts, you can influence behavior through CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
# System Behavior Overrides

## Response Style
- Be concise but thorough
- Always explain complex changes
- Prefer functional programming patterns
- Use async/await over promises
- Include error handling in all examples

## Tool Usage
- Always use parallel tool execution when possible
- Verify file existence before editing
- Run tests after any code change
- Use git status before committing

## Code Generation
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement logging for debugging
```

## Best Practices from the Trenches {#best-practices}

### 1. Context Management
- **Use `/compact` proactively** - Don't wait for context overflow
- **Strategic conversation splitting** - New conversation for new features
- **Reference external docs** - Use @ imports rather than pasting

### 2. Tool Orchestration
- **Parallel execution** - Claude can run multiple tools simultaneously
- **Tool chaining** - Combine read → analyze → write in single request
- **Verification loops** - Always verify changes with appropriate tools

### 3. Prompt Engineering
- **Be specific about constraints** - "Fix this without changing the API"
- **Provide context upfront** - "Working on a React 18 app with TypeScript"
- **Use examples** - "Format like our existing components"

### 4. Debugging Workflows
```
1. Reproduce: "Run the failing test and show me the output"
2. Isolate: "Create a minimal reproduction of this issue"
3. Analyze: "Think about why this might be happening"
4. Fix: "Implement a fix that handles edge cases"
5. Verify: "Run all tests to ensure no regressions"
```

### 5. Code Review Practices
- Use Claude for pre-review: "/review before I submit PR"
- Security-focused reviews: "Review for security vulnerabilities"
- Performance reviews: "Analyze for performance bottlenecks"
- Accessibility reviews: "Check for a11y issues"

### 6. Learning and Documentation
- Generate examples: "Show me 5 different ways to implement this"
- Create documentation: "Document this API with examples"
- Explain complex code: "Explain this algorithm step by step"
- Best practices: "What are the best practices for this pattern?"
