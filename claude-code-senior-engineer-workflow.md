## Project Onboarding Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Exploration (First 10 Minutes)

```bash
# Start Claude with extended context
claude code

# Initialize project understanding
/init

# Create exploration todo list
```

**Use this exploration checklist:**
1. Read README.md and key documentation
2. Analyze project structure
3. Identify technology stack
4. Review recent commits
5. Understand testing approach
6. Check for CLAUDE.md files

### Phase 2: Deep Dive Analysis

```markdown
# .claude/commands/deep-analyze.md
Perform comprehensive project analysis of $ARGUMENTS:

1. Architecture mapping
2. Dependency analysis  
3. Code quality assessment
4. Security audit
5. Performance bottlenecks
6. Technical debt inventory

Generate a detailed report with actionable insights.
```

### Phase 3: Project-Specific Setup

```markdown
# Project CLAUDE.md Template
# [Project Name] Development Guide

## Quick Start
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm test            # Run test suite
npm run lint        # Check code quality
```

## Architecture Overview
- Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Testing: Jest + React Testing Library

## Key Directories
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/api/` - API endpoints
- `src/utils/` - Shared utilities
- `tests/` - Test files

## Development Standards
1. Use TypeScript strict mode
2. Write tests for all new features
3. Follow existing patterns
4. Run linting before commits

## Common Tasks
- Feature implementation: `/project:feature-flow`
- Bug fixes: `/project:fix-issue`
- Refactoring: `/project:safe-refactor`
```

---

## Development Workflow

### The Modern TDD Cycle

```bash
# 1. Start with planning
"ultrathink about implementing user authentication feature"

# 2. Create structured todo list
- [ ] Write authentication tests (failing)
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation
- [ ] Create login endpoint
- [ ] Add middleware for route protection
- [ ] Write integration tests
- [ ] Update documentation

# 3. Execute TDD workflow
/project:tdd-implement authentication
```

### Custom Command: Complete Feature Flow

```markdown
# .claude/commands/feature-flow.md
Implement feature: $ARGUMENTS

Workflow:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/$ARGUMENTS`
2. Write failing tests first (TDD red phase)
3. Implement minimal code to pass tests (green phase)
4. Refactor for quality (refactor phase)
5. Ensure 100% test coverage for new code
6. Run full test suite
7. Check linting and type safety
8. Perform security audit on changes
9. Update relevant documentation
10. Commit with conventional message
11. Push and create PR with detailed description
```

### Parallel Development with Worktrees

```bash
# Setup for parallel feature development
git worktree add ../project-feature-a feature/auth
git worktree add ../project-feature-b feature/api

# Launch parallel Claude instances
claude code ../project-feature-a &
claude code ../project-feature-b &
```

---

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy

```bash
# Custom test command workflow
cat > .claude/commands/test-all.md << 'EOF'
Run comprehensive test suite:

1. Unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
2. Integration tests: `npm run test:integration`  
3. E2E tests with Puppeteer MCP
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Security vulnerability scan
6. Accessibility tests
7. Visual regression tests

Generate coverage report and fail if below 80%.
EOF
```

### Pre-commit Quality Gates

```json
// .husky/pre-commit
{
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": [
      "npm run lint:fix",
      "npm run typecheck",
      "npm test -- --onlyChanged",
      "npm run security:audit"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Debugging & Performance

### Strategic Debugging Workflow

```bash
# 1. Reproduce the issue
/project:debug-reproduce "User reports login fails intermittently"

# 2. Isolate with systematic approach
- Check recent changes: git log --since="2 days ago"
- Review error logs: grep -r "ERROR" logs/
- Analyze network requests
- Check browser console
- Review server logs

# 3. Create minimal reproduction
/project:create-minimal-repro
```

### Performance Optimization Cycle

```markdown
# .claude/commands/perf-optimize.md
Optimize performance for $ARGUMENTS:

1. Profile current performance
   - Measure load times
   - Identify render bottlenecks
   - Check memory usage
   
2. Analyze results
   - Find N+1 queries
   - Detect unnecessary re-renders
   - Review bundle size
   
3. Implement optimizations
   - Add appropriate caching
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Optimize database queries
   
4. Verify improvements
   - Re-run performance tests
   - Compare before/after metrics
```

---

## Git & Collaboration

### Intelligent Commit Workflow

```bash
# Enhanced commit with automatic analysis
git add -A
claude code --dangerously-skip-permissions << 'EOF'
Analyze staged changes and create a commit with:
1. Conventional commit format
2. Detailed description of why (not what)
3. Reference to related issues
4. Co-author attribution
EOF
```

### Pull Request Excellence

```bash
# Automated PR creation with rich context
gh pr create --title "feat: Add user authentication" \
  --body "$(claude code --non-interactive << 'EOF'
Based on commits in this branch, generate a PR description with:
- Summary of changes
- Testing performed
- Screenshots if UI changes
- Breaking changes noted
- Deployment considerations
EOF
)"
```

---

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Agent Architecture Analysis

```bash
claude code << 'EOF'
Launch 5 parallel agents to analyze this codebase:
1. Security Expert - Find vulnerabilities
2. Performance Expert - Identify bottlenecks  
3. Architecture Expert - Assess design patterns
4. Testing Expert - Coverage gaps
5. DevOps Expert - Deployment risks

Synthesize findings into actionable report.

```

### Extended Thinking for Complex Problems

```bash
# Trigger maximum analysis depth
"ultrathink about refactoring this legacy payment system"

# For step-by-step reasoning
"think hard about the implications of migrating to microservices"
```

### Automated Workflow Chains

```bash
# Chain multiple operations
/project:morning-routine && \
/project:check-prs && \
/project:update-dependencies && \
/project:run-security-scan
```

---

## Security & Best Practices

### Security-First Development

```markdown
# .claude/commands/security-audit.md
Perform security audit on $ARGUMENTS:

1. Scan for common vulnerabilities
   - SQL injection points
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - CSRF protections
   - Authentication flaws
   
2. Check dependencies
   - Known CVEs
   - Outdated packages
   - License compliance
   
3. Review secrets management
   - Environment variables
   - API key exposure
   - Commit history scan
   
4. Generate security report
```

### Safe Automation Practices

```bash
# Safe automated operations
claude code --allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob --non-interactive << 'EOF'
Analyze codebase for sensitive data exposure without making changes
EOF

# Dangerous mode with safeguards
claude code --dangerously-skip-permissions << 'EOF'
Fix all linting errors but:
- Create backup branch first
- Run tests after each file change
- Abort if tests fail
EOF
```

## Daily Workflow Example

### Morning Routine

```bash
# 1. Start with context
cd ~/projects/main-app
claude code

# 2. Check status
/project:morning-routine
# This runs: git pull, npm install, check PRs, run tests

# 3. Review todos from yesterday
(TodoRead shows yesterday's unfinished tasks)

# 4. Plan today's work
"think about priorities for today based on sprint goals"
```

### Feature Implementation

```bash
# 1. Pick up ticket
/project:start-ticket JIRA-123

# 2. TDD implementation
/project:tdd-flow "Add user preferences API"

# 3. Continuous quality checks
# After each significant change:
npm run lint && npm test -- --watch
```

### End of Day

```bash
# 1. Review changes
git diff --staged

# 2. Create comprehensive commit
/project:smart-commit

# 3. Update documentation if needed
/project:update-docs

# 4. Push and create PR
/project:create-pr

# 5. Update todos for tomorrow
"Update todo list with remaining tasks and tomorrow's priorities"
```

## Pro Tips & Shortcuts

### Context Management
- Use `/clear` between unrelated features
- Use `/compact` every 2-3 hours
- Keep CLAUDE.md files focused and updated

### Performance Hacks
- Run multiple Claude instances for parallel work
- Use `--non-interactive` for scripted operations
- Batch related file reads with concurrent tool calls

### Quality Shortcuts
```bash
# Quick quality check alias
alias qc='npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test'

# Smart commit alias
alias gc='claude code --dangerously-skip-permissions -c "Create commit"'
```
